The meeting began with an in-memoriam to Charlie Munger (1924–2023). Warren Buffett said Charlie had an inquisitive mind and cared about how everything worked. Charlie first became a director at Berkshire in 1979. Buffett calls him the architect of Berkshire.

Buffett talked about the first quarter results.

Buffett says the first quarter is not representative of the whole year for the insurance business. They are slightly down on railroad earnings. $11.2 billion is quite an improvement from last year. They are expecting earnings to go up modestly this year. The goal is to increase operating earnings each year. Shareholders’ equity has also gone up each year, as has the float (almost). Here’s a summary: The asterisk (\*) below indicates that it does not include cash and US Treasury bills from railroads, utilities, and energy companies.

**So, that’s the story of Berkshire — to increase earnings and decrease shares outstanding.**

And then the questions started.

**On selling 115 million Apple shares**: Buffett says Apple will most likely be their biggest stake by the end of this year. In terms of deploying money, he looks at every stock as ownership of the whole business. According to Warren’s favorite book, “The Intelligent Investor,” the market is there to serve you and not instruct you. Buffett follows that principle to this day.

He said he doesn’t mind paying taxes and encourages all companies to do so. He thinks of it as the federal government owning a percentage of your business.

**On whether he’d invest in Hong Kong and Chinese companies**: Buffett says his primary investments will always be in the USA. American Express has a position in China. He has a position in BYD. His Japanese positions have been good and he sees himself holding those companies for a long time. But he doesn’t think he’ll make any direct investments, although it might be through these other companies. China has done incredibly well, but Buffett doesn’t see himself buying anything big outside of the USA.

**On Berkshire Hathaway Energy’s decline and regulatory environment**: Buffett says Utah has treated them/will treat them well by giving them rates they expect. He thinks private energy companies will be more efficient than public ones. And he thinks Berkshire is the best positioned private energy company.

Greg Abel says that the underlying demand, and costs of meeting that demand are incredible. They work with the states. For example, with Iowa, they made substantial investments and there were specific state regulations. With AI and data centers, the demand doubles. So, he wants proper recovery, or return on the capital invested. Regarding PacifiCorp, all the litigation will be challenged. It will take many years to resolve. He’s going to have to change how they operate those assets. People have worked hard to keep the power on during disasters. Now, they may have to work on things like “de-energizing” — i.e. turn off power during fires, for example. Fundamentally, he needs legislative and regulatory reform across the pacific west states. The gold standard has been Utah — the state caps non-economic damages on wildfire claims. And, they have created a wildfire fund that’ll facilitate liquidity to resolve the situation.

Buffett says the return on equity they have achieved on energy utilities changes from state to state. If you look at the ROEs of Apple or Coca Cola, it’s been impressive. But it hasn’t been great in electric utilities. And climate change will change that equation even more.

**On generative AI**: Buffett says he doesn’t know anything about AI. That doesn’t mean he denies its importance. It’ll be hard to get the genie back into the bottle. He draws an analogy with nuclear weapons. He saw something that made him nervous. He saw an image of him that didn’t come from him — so he thinks the potential for scamming people has increased now. It has potential for good and bad. So, he’d have to wait and see.

**On Geico aging**: Ajit Jain said Geico hasn’t been doing that great with data analytics — technology has been a bottleneck. By the …all demand will be flat over the years. So, they’ll have to adjust their operational costs.

Buffett says owning railroads has worked out really well for him. It’s essential for the country. They only had the opportunity to buy BNSF. He just hopes he can find something similar in other industries.

**On how Buffett would invest a small sum**: Buffett says his method would be to go through the 20,000 pages of Moody’s manual to find interesting businesses. Some time ago, there were hundreds of railroad companies and Buffett read through every one of them. At one point, Buffett knew about the Los Angeles Athletic Club when Charlie thought he was the only one who knew about it. He recommends finding the equivalent of Moody’s. Be interested in the subject rather than being just interested in the money.

Buffett mentioned that the directors need to think for themselves rather than bow to conventional wisdom.

Charlie knew the importance of human behavior and psychology. He gave talks on biases. After explaining it, he believed it was beneath him to use the methods to go one-up on someone. Buffett encouraged people to read Poor Charlie’s Almanack.

**On picking the right heroes in life**: Buffett said his younger sister was there today. It’s important to have someone with the right values. His dad was. He ran away from home with his friends once to Hershey, Pennsylvania. The state police picked them up. They ended up back in Washington, D.C eventually. One of his friends who’d run away with him — his mom ended up in the hospital. Buffett’s dad said “I know you can do better.” His dad was his hero. So, pick the people who you want to be. His sister Bertie once ran away too, but it was just a few miles away to their grandparents’ house. He implied she wasn’t even good at running away.

**On Pilot**: Buffett says a couple of directors had doubts about that deal. But he says Pilot is working well for Berkshire. His friend once told him, “All’s well that _ends_.” Buffett says there’s a podcast about Pilot and recommends everyone listen to it.

Greg says Pilot will serve any fuel customers want. The point is they have exceptional locations — hundreds of them.

**On compounding quality and being physically healthy**: Buffett says you have to be lucky. He was lucky he didn’t get into a bad accident. When he was younger, he wouldn’t have thought he’d make it to 90. Buffett also talked about equal opportunities for women.

**On S&P 500 index’s weighting and Buffett asking his wife to invest in the index in his will**: Buffett says he revises his will every few years. He has left his wife more than she’d need. She doesn’t need to worry about whether she beats the S&P 500 or not. It’s not an economic condition with the rest of his family as well. He shared a story about Paul Getty (who was the richest man in the world in the 1950s) and his will, and all the codicils he’d leave in it. He said humans all have weaknesses — don’t be so hard on yourself but don’t be so forgiving.

**What part of Berkshire is most at risk with AI**: Buffett says anything that’s labor intensive. There will be more leisure time. Some people like having more problems to solve in leisure time. In terms of businesses, Buffett is confident they will figure it out. Keynes wrote a book about what could happen in a hundred years — predicted output per capita would grow incredibly and turned out to be mostly right. But he couldn’t predict it exactly right. Buffett recommends everyone read the Einstein-Szilard Letter, which started the Manhattan project.

**On national debt ballooning**: Buffett says the US debt would be acceptable for a long time because there’s no alternative. He credits Paul Volcker who acted during the crisis to control the situation. He thinks Jay Powell is very wise — he sends out pleas on where to pay attention.

**On work-life balance and if he has any regrets**: Buffett says he can think of all kinds of things that could have been done differently. But he doesn’t like too much self criticism. Who knows one tradeoff is better than another. There’s no point in beating yourself up about the past. Try to do things important to you. Buffett likes the feeling of being trusted. Charlie did too. He won’t be looking to change much. If he’s lucky, he gets another 6–7 years to live. Find what you’re good at (what you enjoy), be kind and the world’s better off.

**Ethical bequest to Berkshire shareholders**: Buffett asks shareholders to read Poor Charlie’s Almanack because Charlie has expressed it well.

He hopes everyone will come to next year’s meeting, and he hopes he can make it as well.
